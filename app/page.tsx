                  I am Matteo Bosshard, an aspiring application developer currently attending the Informatikmittelschule
                  since August 2024. This website serves as a digital portfolio to showcase and document my growth,
                  passion, and skills within the field of software development.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Here, you’ll find a collection of my personal projects, things I’ve built out of curiosity or to solve real problems, as well as work I’ve completed as part of my practical lessons at school. My goal is to continuously improve as a developer, and this space reflects that ongoing journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Whether you're a fellow coder, a potential collaborator, or just curious, feel free to explore and see what I've been working on!
